# Data Contract

This document defines which files belong to the **system** (auto-updatable) and which belong to the **user** (never touched by updates).

## User Layer (NEVER auto-updated)

These files contain your personal data, customizations, and work product. Updates will NEVER modify them.

**User Layer (NEVER auto-updated, personalization goes HERE):**
- `profile.md` (renamed from `cv.md`)
- `config/profile.yml`
- `config/rates.yml`
- `config/platforms.yml`
- `modes/_profile.md`
- `data/leads.md` (was `applications.md`)
- `data/clients.yml`
- `data/portfolio/`
- `data/contracts/`
- `data/invoices/`
- `data/pipeline.md`
- `data/scan-history.tsv`
- `portals.yml` → `config/platforms.yml`
- `reports/*`
- `output/*`
- `interview-prep/` → repurposed for screening (Plan 2)

## System Layer (safe to auto-update)

These files contain system logic, scripts, templates, and instructions that improve with each release.

## The Rule

**If a file is in the User Layer, no update process may read, modify, or delete it.**

**If a file is in the System Layer, it can be safely replaced with the latest version from the upstream repo.**
